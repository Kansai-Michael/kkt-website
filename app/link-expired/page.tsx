/**
 * Landing page for old email links.
 *
 * Until August 2026 our email provider rewrote every link in outbound email to run
 * through email.kansaikaratetarragindi.com.au for click tracking. That host had no
 * valid certificate of its own, so browsers showed families a full-page "attackers
 * might be trying to steal your information" warning instead of the page they wanted.
 *
 * Tracking is off now, but those rewritten links are baked into every email already
 * sitting in people's inboxes. The subdomain points here instead so the certificate is
 * valid and the warning is gone. The original destination is encoded in an opaque blob
 * we can't decode, so everyone lands on this one page — hence the signposts below
 * rather than a redirect.
 *
 * See next.config.ts for the host-based redirect that routes traffic here.
