// Two entries here were learned the hard way and must not be narrowed:
//   - Match bare `google`, not `googlebot`. Google-InspectionTool (the Search
//     Console verification crawler) comes from US IPs; matching only `googlebot`
//     blocks it and site verification silently fails. Bare `google` also covers
//     AdsBot-Google, APIs-Google, Google-Extended and Storebot-Google.
//   - `facebookexternalhit` is Meta's ad-review and link-preview crawler. It was
//     missing here once already and broke Meta Ads previews and landing page
//     quality scores until it was added.
//
// `meta-externalagent` (Meta's newer crawler) and `adidxbot` (Microsoft Ads)
// close the equivalent gaps. The AI crawlers matter because this site serves
// /llms.txt for exactly those agents, and they all originate outside Australia --
// without them here, that file was unreachable by everything it was written for.
